## Why this project?

This portfolio was born from a desire to document my journey at **ÉTS** (École de Technologie Supérieure) starting from my second semester. More than just a resume, it is a laboratory where I centralize my technical projects and my insights as an engineering student.

## Choosing the technology: Hugo 🚀

To build this site, I chose **Hugo**, the static site generator (SSG) written in Go. Here is why:

* **Raw Performance**: Hugo is renowned for being the fastest generator in the world. This site builds in just a few milliseconds.
* **"Docs-as-Code" Architecture**: I write my posts in Markdown, allowing me to version-control all my content with Git, just like my source code.
* **Security and Simplicity**: No database, no vulnerable PHP scripts. Just optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Structure and Goals

The goal of this site is simple:
1.  **Demonstrate** my development and integration skills.
2.  **Explain** the "why" behind my academic projects.
3.  **Share** what I learn with the open-source community.

> "Engineering isn't just about building things; it's about knowing how to explain how they work."

This site is constantly evolving, much like my journey at ÉTS.
