## Hire Me / Get in Touch 🚀

Are you looking for a future engineer passionate about **Information Technology (IT)** and **global infrastructure**? I am currently open to internship opportunities or collaborative projects.

### Why work with me?
* **ÉTS Engineering Mindset**: A structured approach to engineering and solving complex problems.
* **Autonomy**: Capable of managing a project from the initial design to live deployment (like this [portfolio](https://samuelbond.dev/projets/hugo/)!).
* **Curiosity (and Deconstruction)**: I love to take things apart, break them, analyze, and rebuild. It’s my way of understanding exactly how systems work from the inside out.
