More than just a resume, it is a laboratory where I centralize my technical projects and my insights as an engineering student.\nChoosing the technology: Hugo 🚀\r#\rTo build this site, I chose Hugo, the static site generator (SSG) written in Go. Here is why:\nRaw Performance: Hugo is renowned for being the fastest generator in the world. This site builds in just a few milliseconds. \u0026ldquo;Docs-as-Code\u0026rdquo; Architecture: I write my posts in Markdown, allowing me to version-control all my content with Git, just like my source code. Security and Simplicity: No database, no vulnerable PHP scripts. Just optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Structure and Goals\r#\rThe goal of this site is simple:\nDemonstrate my development and integration skills. Explain the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; behind my academic projects. Share what I learn with the open-source community. \u0026ldquo;Engineering isn\u0026rsquo;t just about building things; it\u0026rsquo;s about knowing how to explain how they work.\u0026rdquo;\nThis site is constantly evolving, much like my journey at ÉTS.\n","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/projets/hugosite/","section":"Posts","summary":"A look behind the scenes of this portfolio: from choosing the Hugo framework to hosting, here is how I structured my digital footprint at ÉTS.","title":"Powering my portfolio with Hugo: Why Static?","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/authors/samuel-bond/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Samuel Bond","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/web-development/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web Development","type":"tags"},{"content":"$ curl -L https://samuelbond.dev/hire-me \u0026gt; Processing... 100% \u0026gt; Error: Candidate too awesome.
